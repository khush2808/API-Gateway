Frontend -Middle - Backend

-We need an intermediate layer between the client side and microservices.
-Using this middle layer, when client send request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should respond to that request.
-We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting
-We try to make a api gateway that will act as a middle end.
